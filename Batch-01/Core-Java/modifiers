Class Modifiers
Whenever we are writing our own classes compulsory we have to provide some
information about our class to the jvm.


The only applicable modifiers for Top Level classes are:
1. Public
2. Default
3. Final
4. Abstract
5. Strictfp

Public Classes:
If a class declared as public then we can access that class from anywhere. With in the
package or outside the package.

Default Classes:
If a class declared as the default then we can access that class only within the current
package hence default access is also known as "package level access".

Final Modifier:
Final is the modifier applicable for classes, methods and variables.

Abstract Modifier:
Abstract is the modifier applicable only for methods and classes but not for variables.

Abstract class:
For any java class if we are not allow to create an object such type of class we have to
declare with abstract modifier that is for abstract class instantiation is not possible.

Strictfp:
 strictfp is the modifier applicable for methods and classes but not for variables.
 Strictfp modifier introduced in 1.2 versions.
 Usually the result of floating point of arithmetic is varing from platform to
platform , to overcome this problem we should use strictfp modifier.
 If a method declare as the Strictfp then all the floating point calculations in that
method has to follow IEEE754 standard, So that we will get platform
independent results.

Static modifier:
 Static is the modifier applicable for methods, variables and blocks.
 We can't declare a class with static but inner classes can be declaring as the
static.

Native modifier:
 Native is a modifier applicable only for methods but not for variables and
classes.
 The methods which are implemented in non java are called native methods or
foreign methods.
