JAVA abstract
===============

1)A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract
class in Java.
2)It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).

---------------
Abstract class
----------------

  1)  An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
  2)  It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
  3)  It cannot be instantiated. - It means ki Object/Instance nahi ban skta.
  4)  It can have constructors and static methods also.
  5)  It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the
  body of the method.

NOTE 1: Basically ek contraction hota hain kyuki isme hme return type nahi dena hota hain
as compared to method.Isme hame sirf method declaration  likhne hoti hn Isme body nahi hoti-
 for eg. public abstract int addition(int no.01, int no.02).

NOTE 2: Ek abstract class ke andr he abstract method valid ho skta hain.

Implementation class is responsible to provide implementation

Abstract class

If we are talking about implementation
but not completely (partial
implementation) then we should go for
abstract class.

Every method present inside abstract
class need not be public and abstract.

There are no restrictions on abstract
class method modifiers.

Every abstract class variable need not be
public static final.

There are no restrictions on abstract
class variable modifiers.

It is not require to perform initialization
for abstract class variables at the time of
declaration.

Inside abstract class we can take both static and instance blocks.

Inside abstract class we can take constructor.
