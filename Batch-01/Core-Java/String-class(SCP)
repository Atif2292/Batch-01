Importance of String constant pool (SCP) :

1. In our program if any String object is required to use repeatedly then it is not
recommended to create multiple object with same content it reduces
performance of the system and effects memory utilization.

2. We can create only one copy and we can reuse the same object for every
requirement. This approach improves performance and memory utilization we
can achieve this by using "scp".

3. In SCP several references pointing to same object the main disadvantage in this
approach is by using one reference if we are performing any change the
remaining references will be impacted. To overcome this problem sun people
implemented immutability concept for String objects.

4. According to this once we creates a String object we can't perform any changes
in the existing object if we are trying to perform any changes with those changes
a new String object will be created hence immutability is the main disadvantage
of scp.

Interning of String objects :

By using heap object reference, if we want to get corresponding SCP object , then we
should go for intern() method.
