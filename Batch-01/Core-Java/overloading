Overloading in JAVA
---
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters,
it is known as Method Overloading.
   for example -
  	public String addti1on(int a,int b, int c) {
  		return null;

  	}
  	public String addtion(int a,int b, int d) {
  	return null;
  	}
NOTE:
Overloading is also considered as compile time polymorphism(or) static polymorphism
(or)early biding.

Note :
While resolving overloaded methods exact match will always get high priority,
While resolving overloaded methods child class will get the more priority than parent
class

NOTE:
In overloading method resolution is always based on reference type and runtime object
won't play any role in overloading.
