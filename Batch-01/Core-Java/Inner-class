 Sometimes we can declare a class inside another class such type of classes are
called inner classes.

1. Normal (or) Regular inner class:

If we are declaring any named class inside another class directly without static modifier
such type of inner classes are called normal or regular inner classes.

Example:
class Outer
{
int x=10;
class Inner
{
int x=100;
public void methodOne()
{
int x=1000;
System.out.println(x);//1000
System.out.println(this.x);//100
System.out.println(Outer.this.x);//10
}
}
public static void main(String[] args)
{
new Outer().new Inner().methodOne();
}
}

The applicable modifiers for outer classes are:
1. public
2. default
3. final
4. abstract
5. strictfp

Anonymous inner classes:
 Sometimes we can declare inner class without name such type of inner classes are
called anonymous inner classes.
