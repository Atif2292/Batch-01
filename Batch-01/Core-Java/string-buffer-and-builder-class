StringBuffer :
---
1. If the content will change frequently then never recommended to go for String
object because for every change a new object will be created internally.
2. To handle this type of requirement we should go for StringBuffer concept.
3. The main advantage of StringBuffer over String is, all required changes will be
performed in the existing object only instead of creating new object.(won't create
new object)

Note :
Every method present in StringBuffer is syncronized hence at a time only one thread is
allowed to operate on StringBuffer object , it increases waiting time of the threads and
creates performence problems , to overcome this problem we should go for
StringBuilder.

StringBuilder (1.5v)
---
1. Every method present in StringBuffer is declared as synchronized hence at a
time only one thread is allowed to operate on the StringBuffer object due to this,
waiting time of the threads will be increased and effects performance of the
system.
2. To overcome this problem sun people introduced StringBuilder concept in 1.5v.
