In software design and object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a design
pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to only one instance and
provides a global point of access to that instance.

The singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the
lifetime of an application and provides a way to access that instance.
This can be useful in various situations,such as when you want to centralize
control over a resource, manage configuration settings, or create a shared object.

Here are the key characteristics of a singleton class:

Private Constructor: The singleton class typically has a private constructor,
preventing direct instantiation of the class from outside.

Private Static Instance: It has a private static instance of the class itself.

Public Static Method: It provides a public static method that returns the sole
instance of the class. This method is used to access the instance.

Here is a basic example of a singleton class in Java:

public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
    private Singleton() {
        // Initialization code here
    }

    // Public method to access the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Other methods and properties of the singleton class
}
